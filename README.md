# <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;">  Olympics Athlete Events 

## Context
This dataset provides historical information on the modern Olympic Games, encompassing all Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Initially, both the Winter and Summer Games occurred in the same year until 1992. Subsequently, a staggered approach was adopted, with the Winter Games occurring on a four-year cycle starting from 1994, followed by the Summer Games in 1996, and then the Winter Games in 1998, continuing in this alternating pattern.

The objective of this analysis is to explore and address specific questions aimed at understanding key developments and trends that have transpired throughout the years within the Olympic Games.
